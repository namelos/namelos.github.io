The call to <code>f</code> creates a new environment E1 beginning with a frame in which <code>a</code>, the formal parameter of <code>f</code>, is bound to the argument <code>5</code>. In E1, we evaluate the body f:</div><pre><code class=\\\"language-scheme\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">sum-of-squares</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> a <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> a <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span></code></pre><div>To evaluate this combination, we first evaluate the subexpressions, <code>sum-of-squares</code>, has a value that is a procedure object. (Notice how this value is found: We first look in the first frame of E1, which contains no binding for <code>sum-of-squares</code>. Then we proceed to the enclosing environment, i.e. the global environment, and find the binding from last figure.) The other two subexpressions are evaluated by applying the primitive operations <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> to evaluate the two combinations <code>(+ a 1)</code> and <code>(* a 2)</code> to obtain <code>6</code> and <code>10</code>, respectively.</div><div>Now we apply the procedure object <code>sum-of-squares</code> to the arguments 6 and 10. This results in a new environment E2 in which the formal parameter <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are bound to the arguments. With E2 we evaluate the combination <code>(+ (square x) (square y))</code>. This leads of to evaluate <code>(square x)</code>, where <code>square</code> is found in the global frame and <code>x</code> is <code>6</code>. Once again, we set up a new environment, E3, in which <code>x</code> is bound to 6, and within this we evaluate the body of <code>square</code>, which is <code>(* x x)</code>. Also as part of applying <code>sum-of-squares</code>, we must evaluate the subexpression <code>(square y)</code>, where <code>y</code> is 10. This second call to <code>square</code> creates another environment, E4, in which x, the formal parameter of <code>square</code>, is bound to 10. And within E4 we must evaluate <code>(* x x)</code>.</div><div>The important point to serve is that each call to <code>square</code> creates a new environment containing a binding for <code>x</code>. We can see here how the different frames serve to keep seperate the different local variables all named <code>x</code>. Notice that each frame created by <code>square</code> points to the global environment, since this environment indicated by the <code>square</code> procedure object.</div><div>After the subexpressions are evaluated, the results are returned. The values generated by the two calls to <code>squre</code> are added by <code>sum-of-squares</code>, and this result is returned by <code>f</code>. Since our focus here is on the environment structures, we will not dwell on how these returned values are passed from call to call; however, this is also an important aspect of the evaluation process, and we will return to it in details in chapter 5.</div></div><div class=\\\"section\\\"><h1>3.2.3 Frames as the Repository of Local State</h1><div>We can turn to the environment model to see how procedures and assignment can be used to present object with locla state.

Moreover, the evaluation model, though abstract, provides a correct description of how the interpreter evaluates expressions.</div></div><div class=\\\"section\\\"><h1>3.2.2 Applying Simple Procedures</h1><div>When we introduced the substitution model we showed how the combination <code>(f 5)</code> evaluates to <code>136</code>, given the following procedure definitions:</div><pre><code class=\\\"language-scheme\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">define</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">square</span> x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> x x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">define</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">sum-of-squares</span> x y<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">square</span> x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">square</span> y<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">define</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">f</span> a<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">sum-of-squares</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> a <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> a <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span></code></pre><div>We can analyze the same exmaple using the environment model.</div><div><figure><img src=\\\"/static/ch3-Z-G-5_2018-10-10_06-10-44-3e325b93b1add8118e7dd7714d3fc019.gif\\\"></figure></div><div>This show the three procedure objects created by evaluatin the definition of <code>f</code>, <code>square</code>, and <code>sum-of-square</code> in the global environment.

The call to <code>f</code> creates a new environment E1 beginning with a frame in which <code>a</code>, the formal parameter of <code>f</code>, is bound to the argument <code>5</code>. In E1, we evaluate the body f:</div><pre><code class=\\\"language-scheme\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">sum-of-squares</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> a <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> a <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span></code></pre><div>To evaluate this combination, we first evaluate the subexpressions, <code>sum-of-squares</code>, has a value that is a procedure object. (Notice how this value is found: We first look in the first frame of E1, which contains no binding for <code>sum-of-squares</code>. Then we proceed to the enclosing environment, i.e. the global environment, and find the binding from last figure.) The other two subexpressions are evaluated by applying the primitive operations <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> to evaluate the two combinations <code>(+ a 1)</code> and <code>(* a 2)</code> to obtain <code>6</code> and <code>10</code>, respectively.</div><div>Now we apply the procedure object <code>sum-of-squares</code> to the arguments 6 and 10. This results in a new environment E2 in which the formal parameter <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are bound to the arguments. With E2 we evaluate the combination <code>(+ (square x) (square y))</code>. This leads of to evaluate <code>(square x)</code>, where <code>square</code> is found in the global frame and <code>x</code> is <code>6</code>. Once again, we set up a new environment, E3, in which <code>x</code> is bound to 6, and within this we evaluate the body of <code>square</code>, which is <code>(* x x)</code>. Also as part of applying <code>sum-of-squares</code>, we must evaluate the subexpression <code>(square y)</code>, where <code>y</code> is 10. This second call to <code>square</code> creates another environment, E4, in which x, the formal parameter of <code>square</code>, is bound to 10. And within E4 we must evaluate <code>(* x x)</code>.</div><div>The important point to serve is that each call to <code>square</code> creates a new environment containing a binding for <code>x</code>. We can see here how the different frames serve to keep seperate the different local variables all named <code>x</code>. Notice that each frame created by <code>square</code> points to the global environment, since this environment indicated by the <code>square</code> procedure object.</div><div>After the subexpressions are evaluated, the results are returned. The values generated by the two calls to <code>squre</code> are added by <code>sum-of-squares</code>, and this result is returned by <code>f</code>. Since our focus here is on the environment structures, we will not dwell on how these returned values are passed from call to call; however, this is also an important aspect of the evaluation process, and we will return to it in details in chapter 5.</div></div><div class=\\\"section\\\"><h1>3.2.3 Frames as the Repository of Local State</h1><div>We can turn to the environment model to see how procedures and assignment can be used to present object with locla state.

This produces a procedure object that contains a pointer to the global environment. So far, this is no different from the example we have already seen, except that the body of the procedure itslef a <code>lambda</code> expression.</div><div>The interesting part of the computation happens when we apply the procedure \\\"make-withdraw\\\" to an argument:</div><pre><code class=\\\"language-scheme\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">define</span> W1 <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">make-withdraw</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">100</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span></code></pre><div>We begin, as usual, by setting up an environment E1 in which the formal parameter <code>balance</code> is bound to argument 100. Within this environment, we evaluate the body of make-withdraw, namely the <code>lambda</code> expression. This constucts a new procedure object, whose code is as specified by the <code>lambda</code> and whose environment is E1, the environment in the <code>lambda</code> was evaluated to produce the procedure. The resultin procedure object is the value returned by the call to <code>make-withdraw</code>. This is bound to <code>W1</code> in the global environment, since the <code>define</code> itself is being evaluated in the global environment.</div><div><figure><img src=\\\"/static/ch3-Z-G-8_2018-10-10_07-13-10-0c15abc8098d3de821a62565214456c9.gif\\\"></figure></div></div>\",\"meta\":{\"title\":\"SICP Section 3.2\",\"date\":\"2018-10-09\",\"downloaded\":\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/ch3-Z-G-2.gif @ 2018-10-09 05:11:51\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/sicp-3.2/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/sicp-3-2.json\n// module id = 233\n// module chunks = 243524056326353"],"sourceRoot":""}
